#React E-Commerce Store - LIQRðŸš°

##Short Description
An online store that "sells" water bottles, that was built using React. Each product has its own dedicated page and the checkout page makes it easy to add and remove items, while allowing the user to sign up for free shipping.


##Demo
Checkout the <a href='https://xeniakadar.github.io/project-shopping-cart/' target="_blank">live demo</a>.

##Showcase

The images and the GIF are a great illustration to how the page works - the user starts at the homepage and is directed to the products page. There, users can select products, add them to the cart and checkout once they're ready.
